HouHai
======

HouHai is online game server framework, base on [Tatala](https://github.com/zijan/Tatala).


Right now, the source code is just draft version. It is part of network codes of the online game – “Zombie Planet”. And it can’t be compiled.

“Zombie Planet”, the game’s address is http://rc.qzone.qq.com/1101064313. It is a social game published on Tencent QZone in China. It has online game feature. Players can chat and kill each other. The client side of game is Unity3D using C#. The server side is Java. HouHai is the server framework implements network function. So HouHai repository includes two part, C# client and Java server.

Later, I am going to finish this framework and create a small demo.
